 I study online communication using Natural Language Processing methods with a focus on understanding and incorporating the social context of text data and the people that create it.

I completed my PhD at the University of Michigan where I was a member of the LIT Lab. :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue! After that, I spent a couple of years working as a postdoc in the SMASH group at the University of Edinburgh.
